------------Encryption-----------

1)-----------main.py-------------

This program can encrypt and decrypt text.
enter the program and first write the word and text, then the key to it (0<k<27)
and the program gives you the cipher text. And it works in reverse

2)-----------vzlom.py-----------

And this decrypts the word without a key, 
just write the word and it gives all possible
answers and, by the meaning of mono, will guess its meaning

Good luck :)
